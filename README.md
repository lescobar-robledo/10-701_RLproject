# 10-701_RLproject

There are three `jupyter notebooks` and a `.py` script with helper functions. 

Install the needed libraries. 
1. Run the `Baseline.ipynb` to get the baseline model
2. Run the `Pretrain+Feedback.ipynb` while providing ratings for the gameplay movies, to get the human feedback model and
3. Run the `Rate.ipynb` adjusting the model `.pkl` path you want to get ratings for the desired model. (for blind testing, rename the models as to the observer is not aware of which model it's rating.)
